# 🏢AdventureWorks Data Engineering Pipeline (ADF + Power BI)

This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end data engineering and analytics solution** using **Azure Data Factory**, **SQL-based transformations**, and **Power BI reporting**. The goal is to provide insights into AdventureWorks sales, products, and customer performance using modern data processing techniques and applied **Azure cloud service** to create a modern data lakehouse architecture.

## 🏛️ Architecture

[Architecture](/![WhatsApp Image 2025-08-01 at 5 18 01 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f8e4d28-0afb-4dfe-a28b-932fad0e47e6)

I followed the **medallion architecture** pattern (Bronze, Silver, Gold) for organizing data at different processing stages.

#### Medallion Architecture
- **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion from GitHub repository via Azure Data Factory
- **Silver Layer**: Transformed and cleaned data stored as Parquet files in Azure Data Lake Storage
- **Gold Layer**: Optimized analytics-ready data exposed through views and external tables in Azure Synapse Analytics

---

## Dataset
**AdventureWorks dataset containing**:
- Product Categories and Subcategories
- Products
- Customers
- Calendar (Date dimension)
- Sales (2015-2017)
- Returns
- Territories

**Step-1:** `Bronze Layer`
---
In **Azure Data Factory Pipelines**, I created a Dynamic Pipeline that:
- uses a **`Lookup activity`** to read configuration from `git.json`(parameters)  
Here The output from the above activity is connected to foreach loop
- applied **`ForEach`** loops to dynamically process multiple CSV files   
and Then inside the foreach activity u apply **`copydata`** Activity
- Using **`copydata`** copies data from GitHub to the **Bronze layer** in Azure Data Lake Storage

---

**Step-2:** `silver Layer`
---
- Intermediate transformations handled via **Databricks** notebooks `Transformation_silver.dbc`.
- Cleansing, normalization, and type handling are performed.
- After performing all transformation the data is pushed into silver layer in Azure Data Lake Storage using pyspark `df.write`

---

**Step-3:** `Gold Layer`
---
In **Azure synapse Analytics**,I created SQL scripts like :
- `create schema.sql`, `External Table.sql`, and `create views gold.sql` build optimized star schema views for reporting.
  
    - `create views gold.sql` uses the **OPENROWSET** function to access the data(parquet files) in Azure         data lake storage providing a sql interface over data lake without data duplication and then used          these view to create a external tables to view data for improved query performance and BI reporting.
    - `External Table.sql` we pushed the data to gold layer inform of external table.I implemented master
      key encryption and database scoped credentials for secure data access.File format definition with          Snappy compression for **optimized** performance

- Secure access patterns using managed identities
- Azure Synapse Analytics serves as the analytics engine for your data lakehouse, providing serverless sql pool feature

**Step-4:** Visualization-`Power BI`
---
- Used **SQL END POINTS** to establish a connection between **Synapse** and **POWER BI**
- Consumed data from Gold layer and creates a professional dashboard with visuals.
- `AdventureWorks_PowerBI_reporting.pbix` includes:
    - Sales trends and territory-wise revenue
    - Customer segmentation
    - Product performance
    - Returns and profitability dashboards

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: Data orchestration and ingestion from dynamic GitHub sources.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Bronze layer for raw data.
- **Azure Databricks** – Data transformation (Silver Layer) 
- **SQL Scripts**: Schema creation, gold layer transformations, and view generation.
- **Power BI**: Visual storytelling and dashboards.
- **GitHub**: Source for dynamic CSV datasets.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ Automated Data ingestion pipeline from GitHub using dynamic parameters
- ✅ Layered data architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
- ✅ Real-time insights using Power BI
- ✅ Reusable SQL scripts for schema, external tables, and reporting views
